# Create the Object
# 
# Using the code from the previous exercise, create an instance of Cat and assign it to a variable named kitty.
# 
# Code:
# 
class Cat
end

kitty = Cat.new

# Discussion
# To instantiate a new Cat object, we use the class method ::new. This method returns a new instance of the class it was invoked upon. We now have a Cat object.
# 
# To make use of this new Cat object, we need to assign it to a variable. In the solution, we assign the object to a variable named kitty. This variable can be used to interact with the object in various ways. We'll expand on this topic in the next few exercises.
