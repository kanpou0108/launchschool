# What Are You?
# 
# Using the code from the previous exercise, add an #initialize method that prints I'm a cat! when a new Cat object is initialized.
# 
# Code:

# class Cat
# end
# 
# kitty = Cat.new

# Expected output:
# 
# I'm a cat!


class Cat
  def initialize
    puts "I'm a cat!"
  end
end

kitty = Cat.new

# Discussion
# When defining a class, you usually need to define the #initialize method. #initialize is useful for setting up -- initializing -- an object so the object is ready for immediate use.
# To add #initialize to Cat, define it with the reserved word def. Adding this method lets us execute certain statements when a new Cat object is initialized. In this case, we want to print I'm a cat!. We accomplish this by using #puts.
