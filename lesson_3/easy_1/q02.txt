Question 2

Describe the difference between ! and ? in Ruby. And explain what would happen in the following scenarios:

1. what is != and where should you use it? - 
  - not equal
2. put ! before something, like !user_name - 
  - turns the object into its opposite boolean value
3. put ! after something, like words.uniq! - 
  - mutating version of the method(usually. not all mutating method `!` suffix)
4. put ? before something - 
  - syntax error // ? : is the ternary operator for if...else
5. put ? after something - 
  - it can be part of the method name // ? : is the ternary operator for if...else
6. put !! before something, like !!user_name - 
  - turn the object into its boolean value 


!= means "not equals"
? : is the ternary operator for if...else
!!<some object> is used to turn any object into their boolean equivalent. (Try it in irb)
!<some object> is used to turn any object into the opposite of their boolean equivalent, just like the above, but opposite.
