# Alan wrote the following method, which was intended to show all of the factors of the input number:

# Alyssa noticed that this will fail if the input is 0, or a negative number, and asked Alan to change the loop. How can you change the loop construct (instead of using begin/end/until) to make this work? Note that we're not looking to find the factors for 0 or negative numbers, but we just want to handle it gracefully instead of raising an exception or going into an infinite loop.


def factors(number)
  dividend = number
  divisors = []
  begin
    divisors << number / dividend if number % dividend == 0
    dividend -= 1
  end until dividend == 0
  divisors
end

p factors(0)
