# Hashes are commonly found to be more complex than the simple one we saw earlier:
# 
# ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 402, "Eddie" => 10 }
# It is often the case that each key points to another hash instead of a single value:
# 
# munsters = {
#   "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
#   "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
#   "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
#   "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" }
# }
# Figure out the total age of just the male members of the family.
