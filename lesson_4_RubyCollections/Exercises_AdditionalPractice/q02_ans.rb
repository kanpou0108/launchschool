# Exercise 2
# 
# Add up all of the ages from the Munster family hash:

ages = { "Herman" => 32, "Lily" => 30, "Grandpa" => 5843, "Eddie" => 10, "Marilyn" => 22, "Spot" => 237 }

# Solution 2
# One solution would be to assign a variable to an initial value of 0 and then iterate through the Hash adding each value in turn to the total.
# 
# total_ages = 0
# ages.each { |_,age| total_ages += age }
# total_ages # => 6174
# Another option would be to use a Enumerable#inject method.

p ages.values.inject(:+) # => 6174

# This uses ages.values to make an array, then uses the inject method which is part of the Enumerable module. The strange-looking parameter to inject is simply a variety of the inject method which says "apply the + operator to the accumulator and object parameters of inject".
# 
# As we have previously discussed, Enumerable is included in Array, and it can be useful to augment your knowledge of what you can do with arrays by studying Enumerable. When faced with a problem such as this one however, don't get tempted to go 'method hunting' in order to reach a solution. As demonstrated, even if you don't know the #inject method, the problem can be solved equally well by using #each to iterate through the Hash; you could even use a basic loop to reach the same result.
