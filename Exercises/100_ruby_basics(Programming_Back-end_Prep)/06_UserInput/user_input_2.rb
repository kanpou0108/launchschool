# Your Age in Months

# Write a program that asks the user for their age in years, and then converts that age to months.
# 
# Examples:
# 
# $ ruby age.rb
# >> What is your age in years?
# 35
# You are 420 months old.

puts ">> What is your age in years?"
age = gets.chomp.to_i
# age = gets.chomp
puts "You are #{age * 12} months old."
