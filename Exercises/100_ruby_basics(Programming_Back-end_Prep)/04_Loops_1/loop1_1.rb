# Runaway Loop
# 
# The code below is an example of an infinite loop. 
# The name describes exactly what it does: loop infinitely. 
# This loop isn't useful in a real program, though. 
# Modify the code so the loop stops after the first iteration.
# 
# loop do
#   puts 'Just keep printing...'
# end

# Solution

loop do
  puts 'Just keep printing...'
  break
end

# Discussion
# Stopping a loop is as simple as adding the reserved word break inside the loop. 
# break is nearly always necessary when using loop and doesn't require any conditions. 
# When loop executes a break, it stops iterating immediately and exits the block.
