# Control the Loop
# 
# Modify the following loop so it iterates 5 times instead of just once.
# 
# iterations = 1
# 
# loop do
#   puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
#   break
# end
# 
# Solution

iterations = 1

loop do
  puts "Number of iterations = #{iterations}"
  iterations += 1
  break if iterations > 5
end

# Discussion
# It's important to understand the basics when it comes to loops in Ruby. 
# loop demonstrates what the simplest loop can look like. It iterates over the given block and stops only when the reserved word break is executed. 
# In the original code, break is written with no conditions. This means the loop will stop after the first iteration.
# 
# To modify the loop so it stops only once it's iterated 5 times, we append an if statement to break. 
# How do we know when the loop has iterated 5 times? We need to increment iterations by 1 each time the loop iterates over the block. 
# We can then add the condition iterations > 5 to our if statement.
# 
# Further Exploration
# If the break statement is moved up one line so it runs before iterations is incremented, what would need to be changed?
