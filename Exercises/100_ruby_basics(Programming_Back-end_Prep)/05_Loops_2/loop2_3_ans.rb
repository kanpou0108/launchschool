# Conditional Loop
# 
# Using an if/else statement, run a loop that prints "The loop was processed!" one time if process_the_loop equals true. 
# Print "The loop wasn't processed!" if process_the_loop equals false.

process_the_loop = [true, false].sample

if process_the_loop
  loop do
    puts "The loop was processed!"
    break
  end
else
  puts "The loop wasn't processed!"
end

# Discussion
# 
# The variable given to us, process_the_loop, will be assigned randomly to either true or false. 
# Our goal here is to run the loop only if process_the_loop evaluates to true. 
# We can use an if/else statement to accomplish this task.
# 
# To run a loop that prints "The loop was processed!" once, we can simply add a break immediately following #puts inside loop. 
# We don't need to have any sort of counter variable in this case because we only need to print the string once. 
# Then all we need to do is place puts "The loop wasn't processed!" in the else clause. 
# This will print if process_the_loop evaluates to false.
