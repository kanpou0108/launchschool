# Optional Arguments

# Assume you have the following code:
s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'
p s
puts s.split.inspect
puts s.split(',').inspect
puts s.split(',', 2).inspect

# What will each of the 3 puts statements print?
# 
# Solution
# puts s.split.inspect
# ["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]

# puts s.split(',').inspect
# ["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr", "stu vwx yz"]

# puts s.split(',', 2).inspect
# ["abc def ghi", "jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"]


# Discussion
# The documentation for String#split shows that its signature is:
# 
# split(pattern=nil, [limit]) → anArray
# This signature shows two different ways that the ruby documentation shows optional arguments; the first form (pattern=nil) is used when an optional argument has a default value, while the [] in [limit] tells us that this is an optional argument with no default value. You will sometimes see square brackets around optional arguments that have default values; we'll see this in the next exercise.
# 
# From this, we can tell that calling #split without arguments is equivalent to calling it with one argument, s.split(nil), which causes #split (per the text below the signature) to use a strange global variable named $;. We won't discuss this variable right now, but it will almost always be nil; this is the default. When $; is nil, #split splits the String based on white space. So, our first call to #split returns an Array of 7 elements after splitting s at each sequence of spaces.
# 
# The documentation also tells us that we can supply an explicit value on which to split the String by passing that value as the first argument. This value can be a String or a Regexp; we opt to pass in a String ',' which causes s to be split on commas. We thus get an Array of 3 Strings in the second puts.
# 
# Finally, the documentation tells us that we can specify a limit as the 2nd argument; the limit restricts the split operation so that no more than limit values are returned; any other delimiters will be ignored. So, our 3rd call returns a 2 element Array.
# 
# We can tell that #split returns Arrays by looking at the signature; it shows that the return value is anArray, which is just another way to say that an Array is created and returned by the method.
# 
# It's difficult to tell from the text, but the fact that #split returns the results of a split operation as an Array suggests that it does not alter the original String. This is, in fact, the case; #split does not mutate the String to which it is applied. This can be tested in irb if you are uncertain:
# 
# >> s = 'abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz'
# => "abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"
# >> puts s.split.inspect
# ["abc", "def", "ghi,jkl", "mno", "pqr,stu", "vwx", "yz"]
# => nil
# >> puts s
# "abc def ghi,jkl mno pqr,stu vwx yz"
# => nil
