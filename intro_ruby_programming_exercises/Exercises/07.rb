# What's the major difference between an Array and a Hash?
# â†“
# The major difference between an array and a hash is that a hash contains a key value pair for referencing by key.

# When deciding whether to use a hash or an array, ask yourself a few questions:
# 1)
# Does this data need to be associated with a specific label? 
# If yes, use a hash. 
# If the data doesn't have a natural label, then typically an array will work fine.
# 
# 2)
# Does order matter? 
# If yes, then use an array. 
# As of Ruby 1.9, hashes also maintain order, but usually ordered items are stored in an array.
# 
# 3)
# Do I need a "stack" or a "queue" structure? 
# Arrays are good at mimicking simple "first-in-first-out" queues, or "last-in-first-out" stacks.
