# Add two strings together that, when concatenated, return your first and last name as your full name in one string.
# 
# "<Firstname> <Lastname>"
# For example, if your name is John Doe, think about how you can put "John" and "Doe" together to get "John Doe".

string1 = "Bob"
string2 = "Smith"

puts string1 + " " + string2
