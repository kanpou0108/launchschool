# Write a method that takes a year as input and returns the century. 
# The return value should be a string that begins with the century number, and ends with st, nd, rd, or th as appropriate for that number.
# 
# New centuries begin in years that end with 01. So, the years 1901-2000 comprise the 20th century.
