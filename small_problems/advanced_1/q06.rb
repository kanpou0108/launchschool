# Permutations
# 
# The elements of an Array can be permuted, that is, arranged, in a variety of different sequences. Such rearrangements are called permutations. So, for example, both [2, 3, 1] and [1, 3, 2] are permutations of the array [1, 2, 3]. The complete list of permutations for [1, 2, 3] is an Array of Arrays in which each nested Array is a permutation of the original Array:
# 
# [
#   [1, 2, 3],
#   [1, 3, 2],
#   [2, 1, 3],
#   [2, 3, 1],
#   [3, 1, 2],
#   [3, 2, 1]
# ]
# Write a method that takes an Array, and returns an Array of Arrays that represent the permutations of the original Array. The order of the permutations does not matter. You may not use the Array#permutations method nor any other standard method that is meant to generate permutations -- please devise your own way of generating the permutations.
# 
# For simplicity, you may assume that each element of the array has a unique value.
# 
# Examples:
