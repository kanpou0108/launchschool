Things to think about

1. Where did that format method come from?
  Kernel Modele - format method
  Module: Kernel (Ruby 2_4_0)
  https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.4.0/Kernel.html#method-i-format

2. Note how we have to be very careful about converting inputs to integers or floats.
  amount.to_f() < 0
  
3. This "$#{format('%02.2f', monthly_payment)}" is really hard to read, what's happening? 
  Hint: study the Kernel#format documentation here.
  
  Module: Kernel (Ruby 2.2.0)
  http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.2.0/Kernel.html#method-i-format

4. What does the code look like with the optional parentheses removed? Can you still recognize it?
  yes.
