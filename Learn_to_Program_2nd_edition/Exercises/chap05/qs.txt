5.6 A Few Things to Try
Ex.1
• Full name greeting. Write a program that asks for a person’s first name, then middle, and then last. Finally, it should greet the person using their full name.

Ex.2
• Bigger, better favorite number. Write a program that asks for a person’s favorite number. Have your program add 1 to the number, and then suggest the result as a bigger and better favorite number. (Do be tactful about it, though.)
