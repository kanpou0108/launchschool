- Arrays and Hashes
- Common mistakes when using select and map
- The Enumerable module

# Array
## part1
- iterate over an array of numbers, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] and print out each value (loop vs iteration)
- same as above, except print out the number only if the value is greater than 5
- append 12 to end of array
- prepend 0 to beginning of array
- remove the 12, and append a 3
- remove duplicate using 1 method (ie, don't loop or iterate)

## part2
- extract all odd numbers into new array (selection)

## part3
- increment all numbers by 1 (transformation - new vs mutation)

## part4
- find sum of all numbers

# Hash
Suppose you hava a hash hsh = {a:1, b:2, c:3, d:4}

## part1
- get the value of "b"
- add this key/value pair to the hash: {e: 5}
- iterate over the hash and print out the keys and values

## part2
- print out key/value pairs where the value is less than 3.5

## part3
- return a new hash where value is less than 3.5

## part4
- delete all key/value pairs where value is less than 3.5

# Other
## part1
- can an array contain hashes? vice versa?
  - yes. definitely.
- modifying an array value in a hash
  - yes.
- modifying an hash element in an array
  - yes.

# Common Methods and Mistakes Beginners Mistakes
## part1
- iteration
- transformation
- selection
  - all?
  - any?
