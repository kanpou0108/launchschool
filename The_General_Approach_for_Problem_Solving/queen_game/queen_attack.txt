# In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.
# A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.

data:
  - 8x8 board
  - [x, y] for the white queen
  - [x, y] for the black queen
  
Queens
  - defaults
  - validation
    - can't be the same position
  - to_s: string rep(representation?, repsen?) of the board.
    - 8 rows, underscores and spaces
    - print out either W or B if the position is occupied by a queen
  - attack?
    - same row
      - same x for white and black queens
    - same column 
      - same y for white and black queens
    - same diagonal   # hardest part of this problem.
      - abs(x2 - x1) == abs(y2 - y1)
