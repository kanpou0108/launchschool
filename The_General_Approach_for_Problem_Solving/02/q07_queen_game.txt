Queen Attack:

In the game of chess, a queen can attack pieces which are on the same row, column, or diagonal.
A chessboard can be represented by an 8 by 8 array.
So if you're told the white queen is at (2, 3) and the black queen at (5, 6), then you'd know you've got a set-up like so:

_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ W _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ B _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

You'd also be able to answer whether the queens can attack each other. 
In this case, that answer would be yes, they can, because both pieces share a diagonal.

Understanding the Problem:
- input:
  - a String representation of a board with two queens
  - W/B, and _
- output:
  - true/false
- rules:
  - true if the two queens are
    - same row
      - W's row == B's row
    - same column
      - W's column == B's column
    - same diagonal
      - distance of rows == distance of columns
        - distance: (x1 - x2).abs or (y1 - y2).abs

Data Structure:
- chess board: 8x8 array of arrays
  - easier to express rows ,columns and diagonals
