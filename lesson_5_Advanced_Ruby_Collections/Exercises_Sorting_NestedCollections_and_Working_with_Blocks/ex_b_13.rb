# Exercise 13
# 
# Given the following data structure, return a new array containing the same sub-arrays as the original 
# but ordered logically according to the numeric value of the odd integers they contain.
# 
# arr = [[1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9], [1, 8, 3]]

# The sorted array should look like this:
# [[1, 8, 3], [1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9]]

# in: array of array
# out: The sorted array logically according to the numeric value of the odd integers they contain.

arr = [[1, 6, 7], [1, 4, 9], [1, 8, 3]]

arr.sort do |arr_a, arr_b|
