# Question 9
# For the second part of the solution, extracting the data, the format that is required in each case is as follows:

all_orders =[
  {customer_id: 12, customer_name: 'Emma Lopez', total_order_value: 483.48},
  {customer_id: 32, customer_name: 'Michael Richards', total_order_value: 205.65}
]

# fulfilled_orders =[
#   {customer_id: 12, customer_name: 'Emma Lopez', order_value: 425.48},
#   {customer_id: 32, customer_name: 'Michael Richards', order_value: 120.00}
# ]

# For the unfiltered totals, the team again comes up with four possible solutions. Select all those that correctly implement the requirements.

customer_orders = [
  {
    customer_id: 12,
    customer_name: 'Emma Lopez',
    orders: [
      { order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 135.99 },
      { order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 289.49 },
      { order_fulfilled: false, order_value: 58.00 }
    ]
  },
  {
    customer_id: 32,
    customer_name: 'Michael Richards',
    orders: [
      { order_fulfilled: true, order_value: 120.00 },
      { order_fulfilled: false, order_value: 85.65 }
    ]
  }
